 * There is no guarantee that this part will work correctly, if at all, in every version of Mson.
 *
 * For reference, here is a list of corners that when taken in order produce a cube:
 * Vertices
 *      [ 0, 0, 0 ] wds 0
 *      [ 1, 0, 0 ] eds 1
 *      [ 1, 1, 0 ] eus 2
 *      [ 0, 1, 0 ] wus 3
 *      [ 0, 0, 1 ] wdn 4
 *      [ 1, 0, 1 ] edn 5
 *      [ 1, 1, 1 ] eun 6
 *      [ 0, 1, 1 ] wun 7
 * Quads (faces):
 * East:  [ edn, eds, eus, eun ]
 * West:  [ wds, wdn, wun, wus ]
 * UP:    [ eus, wus, wun, eun ]
 * DOWN:  [ edn, wdn, wds, eds ]
 * SOUTH: [ wdn, edn, eun, wun ]
 * NORTH: [ eds, wds, wus, eus ]
